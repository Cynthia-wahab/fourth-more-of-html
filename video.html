    <h2 style="color: blueviolet;">How to Use Audio and Video Tag</h2>
    
    <p>#To add a audio we need to write audio tag. It's almost same as img tag. only need to add "controls" in it.
      Example: <p style="color: brown;"> &lt;audio controls src="media file"&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;</p>

    <h4>lyrics of pretty little baby..</h4>
    <p>Pretty little baby (ya-ya) <br>
    Pretty little baby (ya-ya) <br>
    Pretty little baby, you say that maybe <br>
    You'll be thinkin' of me and try to love me <br>
    Pretty little baby, I'm hoping that you do <br>
    You can ask the flowers, I sit for hours <br>
    Tellin' all the bluebirds, the bill and coo birds <br>
    Pretty little baby, I'm so in love with you<br>
    Now is just the time, while both of us are young<br>
    Puppy love must have its day<br>
    Don't you know it's much more fun to love<br>
    While the heart is young and gay?<br>
    Meet me at the car hop or at the pop shop<br>
    Meet me in the moonlight or in the daylight<br>
     Pretty little baby, I'm so in love with you (ah-ah)<br>
    Now is just the time, while both of us are young<br>
    Puppy love must have its day<br>
    Don't you know it's much more fun to love<br>
    While the heart is young and gay?
